## Introduction
This project was made for an assignment for University of Leeds for the module GEOG5003M - Programming for Geographical Information Analysis.

The aim of the programme is to have agents interact with the environment, producing both visual and text outputs.

## Technologies
Spyder (Python 3.8)

## Files
in.txt - A txt file with csv data in it, each value being the equivilent to a pixel.

## The programme
The programme for the user to run is the model.py, supplemented by agentframework.py.
This is the final programme, showing the agents animating and moving around by means of a .GIF.
The environment is plotted from the in.txt file, the agents are then created randomly.
The agents move around the environment created in a random fashion - 'eating' the parts it comes into contact too.
The agents then share parts they've eaten with a neighbour and a calculation is written out as a csv file at the end of the script to show how much has been stored by each agent.

## Issues
The programmer had issues with getting the animation process running as is in the lecturers example code.

## Licence
Licence for this project code is a MIT licence. See LICENCE for more details.
